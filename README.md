DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS
Specification	Rating	Simulation Details 
Input voltage	20 V	PSIM Plat Form
Time Step 10-7 sec
Output Voltage	400 V	
Power	200 W	
Inductors	L1=130 μH, L2=700 μH	
Capacitors	C0=100 μF, C1-C3=22 μF	
Diodes	D0, D2, D3 (STPSC10H065)	
	D1, (MBR10100)
	
Switches	S1  (FDPF3860T)
	
	        S2  (STW28N65M2)

  For the successful simulation keep the time step as 10E-7 and run the simulation for 1 to 2 sec depending on the memory size. If the memory is low on the PSIM directory go for 1 sec simulation.
